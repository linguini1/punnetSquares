# Punnet Squares

This was meant as a small time saver for my grade 11 biology class. Currently the program only supports monohybrid and dihybrid punnet squares, and until I have incentive to draw any larger punnet squares, there won't be any additional functionality.

If you discover any bugs or have improvements for more efficient code, please let me know under the issues forum so I can make those changes.

Hopefully this can save you a little time, but I'm sure there's better web apps for this same issue. Enjoy :)
